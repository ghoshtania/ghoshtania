Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a PhD graduate student in computational physics at the University of Houston, specializing in advanced algorithms for network science and community detection. I developed graph clustering algorithms that enhance hierarchical clustering accuracy and optimize community detection. My research employs quantitative analysis and statistical modeling to uncover hidden structures in complex networks. Additionally, I model asset pricing with conformable Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) models, achieving superior results in various applications.
