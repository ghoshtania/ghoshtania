## Hi there 👋

<!--
**ghoshtania/ghoshtania** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a PhD graduate student in computational physics at the University of Houston, specializing in advanced algorithms for network science and community detection. I developed graph clustering algorithms that enhance hierarchical clustering accuracy and optimize community detection. My research employs quantitative analysis and statistical modeling to uncover hidden structures in complex networks. Additionally, I model asset pricing with conformable Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) models, achieving superior results in various applications.
- 👩‍🏫 Currently I’m a PhD graduate student in computational physics at the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/). I have obtained my integrated BSMS from [IISER-kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/#gsc.tab=0).
- 🌱 Enthusiastic about learning: Advanced stochastic processes and their applications in quantitative finance. Machine learning applications in finance, including risk assessment and algorithmic trading strategies.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving large-scale data analysis, mathematical modeling, or quantitative finance.
- 🤔 I’m looking for opportunities in quantitative researcher roles or data scientist positions, and I’m always open to exploring interdisciplinary projects that blend data science with complex networks.
- 📫 How to reach me: Via [email](ghoshtania96@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghoshtania96/).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to travel the world 🌎 and take beautiful pictures 📷! I also enjoy cooking 👩‍🍳.
